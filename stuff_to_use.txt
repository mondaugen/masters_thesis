Stuff I have implemented and have experience with:
+ means in progress
* means not at all done

Survey of high-resolution frequency estimation
----------------------------------------------
Basis pursuit
Derivative method
Reassignment method
Parabolic interpolation
Adaptive Quasi-harmonic model

Partial tracking
----------------
McAulay Quatieri
HMM of Depalle*
my LP method needs to be tweaked, tested+

Multiple F0 estimation
----------------------
Technique of Puckette / Doval+
Cepstrum (performs quite poorly, needs higher level decision making)

Partial grouping
----------------
Grouping by common AM and FM*
Grouping by harmonicity+
