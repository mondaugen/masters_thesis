Stuff I have implemented and have experience with:
+ means in progress
* means not at all done

Survey of high-resolution frequency estimation
----------------------------------------------
Basis pursuit
    o-p-u-l-e-n-c-e
    multipitch_bpdn
Derivative method
    mumt-605-final-project
Reassignment method
    signal_modeling
Parabolic interpolation+
    sinusoid_tracker (but in C only?)
Adaptive Quasi-harmonic model
    qhm

Partial tracking
----------------
McAulay Quatieri
    sinusoid_tracker
HMM of Depalle*
my LP method needs to be tweaked, tested+
    o-p-u-l-e-n-c-e

Multiple F0 estimation
----------------------
Technique of Puckette / Doval+
Cepstrum (performs quite poorly, needs higher level decision making)

Partial grouping
----------------
Grouping by common AM and FM*
Grouping by harmonicity+
