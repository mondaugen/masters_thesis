\section{Introduction}
In the previous experiment we showed it was possible to associate data points
representing underlying partial trajectories to particular sources and discard
spurious points. It remained, however, to connect these trajectories between
analysis frames. In this experiment we will use variations on a linear program
solving the $L$-shortest through a lattice to find solutions to this problem.

\section{Methodology}
We start from the same theoretical data as in experiment 1. These data are
considered as nodes in a graph. Each of the $N$ nodes has some defined distance
from the other $N$ nodes in the graph. Connections between nodes in the graph
are represented by edges. We would like to define a measurement of the cost of
choosing a particular set of edges. One such cost function is the linear cost
function. We encode in a vector $\mathbf{c}$ the cost of connections between
nodes: Here $c_{Nj+i}$ is the distance from node $i$ to node $j$. If we define
the vector $\mathbf{x}$ such that $x_{Nj+i} = 1$ if there is a connection
between node $i$ and node $j$ or $\mathbf{x} = 0$ if there is no connection,
then the function $C(x) = \mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{x}$ quantifies the cost of the set
of connections encoded in $\mathbf{x}$. Assume we are trying to find the set of
connections with minimal cost, that means the vector $\mathbf{x}^{\ast}$ for
which $C(\mathbf{x})$ attains a minimum. Besides being trivial and
uninformative if $\mathbf{x}$ is unconstrained, we can encode desirable
properties of the resulting set of connections by enforcing constraints on
$\mathbf{x}$.

\subsection{Constraint 1: Overall graph flow}
The problem at hand is to discover partials whose instantaneous frequency and
amplitude are varying in time. We can constrain the linear program such that the
paths produced represent the trajectory of an underlying partial, the nodes
being the descrete observations we do have of the paritial. We arrange the
partials on a 2-dimensional plane with time increasing to the right and
frequency increasing upward. This arrangement is arbitrary---the distance we
define between nodes will usually not reflect their arrangement on this plane---
but it helps to visualize how the constraints are chosen.

As we are interested in separating the sets of nodes afterward one constraint we
can enforce is that no node accept more than 2 connections; one in-going
and the other out-going.
