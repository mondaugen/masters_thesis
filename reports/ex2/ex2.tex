\section{Introduction}
In the previous experiment we showed it was possible to associate data points
representing underlying partial trajectories to particular sources and discard
spurious points. It remained, however, to connect these trajectories between
analysis frames. In this experiment we will use variations on a linear program
solving the $L$-shortest through a lattice to find solutions to this problem.
\section{Methodology}
We start from the same theoretical signals as in experiment 1 with added
spurious data.
