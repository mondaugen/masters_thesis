\chapter{Extended phase model}

In Section~\ref{sec:mqfmfromphase} it was shown how a cubic phase function could
be postulated from two connected measurements (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialtracking}) giving a cubic phase polynomial. Here we will
demonstrate how to include the additional phase polynomial coefficients
estimated using DDM in calculating a phase function. In a later section we will
compare the synthesis quality of the classical McAulay-Quatieri
approach with our new method.

\section{Estimating sinusoid of cubic phase: McAulay-Quatieri method}

The sum-of-sinusoids model of McAulay and Quatieri estimates these coefficients
in an indirect way \cite{mcaulay1986speech}. Given two local maxima of the
DTSTFT $X(\tau_0,\omega_0)$ and $X(\tau_1,\omega_1)$, where $H = \tau_1 -
\tau_0$ we can conjecture a cubic
polynomial phase function for the imaginary part of the phase argument

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\phi}(n) = \Im\left\{c_3\right\} (n-\tau_0)^3 + \Im\left\{c_2\right\} (n-\tau_0)^2 + \Im\left\{c_1\right\} (n-\tau_0) + \Im\left\{c_0\right\}
\end{equation}

By noting that we have 2 measurements of the phase and frequency,
$\angle\{X(\tau_0,\omega_0)\}$ and $\angle\{X(\tau_1,\omega_1)\}$, and the frequency
is the derivative of the phase, we can solve for the coefficients of the
polynomial phase function using the following linear system of equations,
assuming the DTSTFT was computed using an even window
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0   & 0     & 0 & 1 \\
        H^3 & H^2   & H & 1 \\
        0   & 0     & 1 & 0 \\
        3 H^2 & 2 H & 1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Im\{c_3\} \\
        \Im\{c_2\} \\
        \Im\{c_1\} \\
        \Im\{c_0\}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \angle\{X(\tau_0,\omega_0)\} \\
        \angle\{X(\tau_1,\omega_1)\} + 2 \pi M \\
        \omega_0 \\
        \omega_1        
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
We choose $M$ so that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:minfmmq}
    \int_{0}^{H}(\frac{d^{2}\tilde{\phi}}{dt^2}(t))^{2}dt
\end{equation}
is minimized in order to have a smooth evolution of phase in the interpolated
region. $M$ is necessary because some integer number of periods of a sinusoid
will have passed from times $\tau_{0}$ to $\tau_{1}$. Informally we choose $M$
so that a polynomial describing the phase evolution between these two times
takes a direct route, which is a plausible criterion because a signal with more
radical phase variation would unlikely exhibit a spectrum that could be well
described by two points in the time-frequency plane, i.e., the signal
would exhibit a large bandwidth. See \cite[p.~751]{mcaulay1986speech} for
further clarification.

As only two measurements of the amplitude of the sinusoid are available,
$|X(\tau_0,\omega_0)|$ and $|X(\tau_1,\omega_1)|$, the coefficients
$c_3$ and $c_2$ are purely imaginary and the real parts of $c_1$ and $c_0$ are
determined as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        H & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re\{c_1\} \\
        \Re\{c_0\}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \log(|X(\tau_0,\omega_0)|) \\
        \log(|X(\tau_1,\omega_1)|)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{Estimating parameters of a sinusoid with cubic
phase\label{sec:cubicphasepolyest} }

In this section we describe how to obtain a cubic phase polynomial from
local estimations of the coefficients of a quadratic phase polynomial.

A complex sinusoid with cubic phase has the following form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cubicphasepoly}
    \phi(n) = \exp \left(c_3 n^{3} + c_2 n^{2} + c_1 n + c_0 \right)
\end{equation}
One with quadratic phase has this form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quadraticphasepoly}
    x(n) = \exp \left(a_2 n^{2} + a_1 n + a_0 \right)
\end{equation}
with $c_{i} \in \mathbb{C}$ and $a_{i} \in \mathbb{C}$.

We can estimate the coefficients of Equation~\ref{eq:quadraticphasepoly} using the DDM. From
Equation~\ref{eq:ddmsyseq}, we define the three functions
\begin{equation}
    X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} w(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} 2 m w(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    -j 2 \pi \frac{k}{M} X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau , k \right) + 
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \frac{dw}{dn}(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
Where $M$ is the length of the window and $k$ is the frequency
``bin''\footnote{For tractability, the functions $X(\tau,k)$ are only evaluated at
    a finite number of frequencies, which are often called ``bins'' in the
signal processing literature.}. We also
only consider $x$ at the samples $m = [0, \dotsc, M-1]$ because we can always
shift the time reference to view an arbitrary contiguous segment of signal with
these indices.

We then find $k^{\ast}$ such that $X_{p_{1}}$ is maximum. If multiple components
are present in the signal and are sufficiently separated in frequency, we can
split the signal up into frequency bands and find local maxima. A technique for
doing so is described in \cite[p.~42]{serra1989system}. To have a system of
equations with a unique solution, we take the two adjacent bins $k-1$ and $k+1$
to have enough unique atoms for Equation~\ref{eq:ddmsyseq}. These bins should
only contain energy from the component whose parameters we are interested in
measuring --- this is true if the components are adequately separated in time
and frequency. We could choose only two bins to have a non-singular system, and
there are many possibilities for choosing different atoms
\cite[p.~4639]{betser2009sinusoidal}. We choose three from the same frame to
have improved estimation accuracy in situations where components are adaquately
separated in frequency, while avoid a more sophisticated local peak selection
procedure. Then $a_2$ and $a_1$ can be determined by solving the linear system
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) \\
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) \\
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_1 \\
        a_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) \\
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) \\
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
With $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ determined, we can use Equation~\ref{eq:ddmestc0} to
estimate $a_0$. We will write $a^{\tau}_{i}$ to refer to coefficient $i$
determined at time $\tau$.

\section{A cubic interpolating phase polynomial from DDM-estimated coefficients}

Once the $\boldsymbol{a}^{\tau}$ have been determined
at two times $\tau_{0}$ and $\tau_{1}$, with $H = \tau_{1} - \tau_{0}$ and these
times have between determined as connected (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialtracking}), we can write a system of equations
to determine an interpolating cubic phase polynomial. To avoid numerical
instabilities and for simplicity, we shift the time origin so that $\tau_{0} =
0$. This means $c_0 = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}$. To reduce the size
of the system, we require that 
\[
    \frac{d \phi}{d n} \left(\frac{H}{2} \right)
    =
    \frac{1}{2}
    \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{1} \right\} + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{1}
    \right\} \right)
\]
and
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \phi}{d n^{2}} \left(\frac{H}{2}
    \right)
    =
    \frac{1}{2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
    a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right)
\]
i.e., the frequency and first-order frequency modulation in the middle of the
segment are the average of the two measured coefficients. Finally we require
\[
    \phi \left( H \right)
    =
    \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{0} \right\} - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}
    + 2 \pi U^{\ast}
\]
where $U^{\ast} \in \mathbb{Z}$ is determined to minimize
Equation~\ref{eq:minfmmq}, in this case:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:minfmcubic}
    \tilde{U} = \argmin_{U} \int_{0}^{H} \left(
    6 c_3 t + 2 c_2 \right)^{2} dt
\end{equation}
which is then rounded to the nearest integer to give $U^{\ast}$. To summarize we have
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^{3} & H^{2} & H \\
        \frac{3}{4}H^{2} & H & 1 \\
        3 H & 2 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{3} \\
        c_{2} \\
        c_{1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{0} \right\} - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}
            + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \\
        \frac{1}{2}
        \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{1} \right\} + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{1}
        \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{1}{2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Solving for $c_1, \dotsc, c_3$, we have
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{3} \\
        c_{2} \\
        c_{1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{4}{H^3} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        - \frac{2}{H^{2}} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{-6}{H^2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        - \frac{3}{H} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right)
        + \frac{1}{4}  \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
            a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{-H}{4}  \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
            a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right) 
        + \frac{3}{H} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        -  \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
and then $\tilde{U}$ is determined using Equation~\ref{eq:minfmcubic} to be
\[
    \tilde{U} = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \left[ H \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1
            \right\} + \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right)
        -2 \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\} - \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} \right) \right]
\]
and then rounded to obtain $U^{\ast}$.

\section{A cubic amplitude polynomial from DDM-estimated coefficients \label{sec:cubicamppoly}}

Solving for the cubic polynomial describing the local amplitude function
\begin{equation}
    \mu(n) = \exp \left(d_3 n^{3} + d_2 n^{2} + d_1 n + d_0 \right)
\end{equation}
is more straightforward analytically as it does not require solving to maximize
the smoothness of resulting polynomial. To require continuity at the end-points
of our polynomial, we require
\[
    \mu(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
and
\[
    \mu(H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
\]
The first constraint is satisfied simply by setting $d_0 = \Re \left\{
a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}$ as in Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepoly}. The second will be
accounted for in a constrained least-squares solution for the other
coefficients. The other observations are
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{dn} (0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{dn} (H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^2 \mu}{dn^2} (0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^2 \mu}{dn^2} (H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_2 \right\}
\]
The constrained least-squares problem to be solved is then
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
        3 H^2 & 2 H & 1 \\
        0 & 2 & 0 \\
        6 H & 2 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_3 \\
        d_2 \\
        d_1
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_2 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
subject to
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^3 & H^2 & H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_3 \\
        d_2 \\
        d_1
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
This can be solved using numerical methods, in particular, using a specific
interpretation of weighted least-squares \cite[p.~266]{golub1996matrix}.

\section{A quintic phase polynomial from DDM-estimated coefficients\label{sec:quinticphasepoly}}

Solving for the coefficients of a quintic phase polynomial is done very
similarly to Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepoly}. The quintic phase polynomial is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quinticphasepoly}
    \phi(n) = \exp \left(c_5 n^{5} + c_4 n^{4} + c_3 n^{3} + c_2 n^{2} + c_1 n + c_0 \right)
\end{equation}
We have
\[
    \phi(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \phi}{d n}(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \phi}{d n^{2}}(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
and solving for the remaining coefficients is done using the linear system of
equations:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^5 & H^4 & H^3 \\
        5 H^4 & 4 H^3 & 3 H^2 \\
        20 H^3 & 12 H^2 & 6 H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_5 \\
        c_4 \\
        c_3
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -\frac{ H^{2} }{2} \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } - H \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } +
            \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } + 2 \pi U^{\ast}\\
        -H \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } + \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } \\
        \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 }
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The smoothness maximizing $\tilde{U}$ is found as
% M=np.round((20.*H*(w_i0+w_i1)+(H**2.)*(psi_i0-psi_i1)+40.*(phi_i0-phi_i1))/(80.*np.pi))
\[
    \tilde{U} = \frac{1}{80 \pi} \left[ 20 H ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } + \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } )
        + H^2 ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } )
        + 40 ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_0 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } ) \right]
\]
and then rounded to produce $U^{\ast}$ as above.

The quintic interpolating phase polynomial has been proposed in a previous paper
\cite{girin2003comparing} although they do not directly estimate the frequency
slope, choosing instead to derive it using the difference in frequency between
two analysis frames.

\section{A quintic amplitude polynomial from DDM-estimated
coefficients\label{sec:quinticamppoly}}

Solving for the quintic amplitude polynomial
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quinticamppoly}
    \mu(n) = \exp \left(d_5 n^{5} + d_4 n^{4} + d_3 n^{3} + d_2 n^{2} + d_1 n + d_0 \right)
\end{equation}
is as follows:
\[
    \mu(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{d n}(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \mu}{d n^{2}}(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
and solving for the remaining coefficients is done using the linear system of
equations:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^5 & H^4 & H^3 \\
        5 H^4 & 4 H^3 & 3 H^2 \\
        20 H^3 & 12 H^2 & 6 H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_5 \\
        d_4 \\
        d_3
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -\frac{ H^{2} }{2} \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } - H \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } +
            \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } \\
        -H \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } + \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } \\
        \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 }
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{Evaluation}

We compared the quality of an analysis-synthesis system using the
original method proposed by McAulay and Quatieri (MQ), the cubic interpolation
method, and the quartic interpolation method. Frequency- and
amplitude-modulated sinusoids were synthesized and then analysed frame-by-frame
using the DDM to estimate their initial phase (amplitude), frequency (amplitude
slope), and frequency-modulation (amplitude-modulation). Afterwards, the signals
were resynthesized using the estimated parameters and compared to the original.
We are interested in seeing in what cases higher order phase polynomials will
improve the accuracy of synthesis.

\subsection{The analysis-synthesis system}

\subsubsection{The McAulay-Quatieri method}

For the MQ method, the model is a sinusoid of constant frequency (linear phase)
in each analysis frame. To estimate the frequency of this sinusoid we find the
bin with the most energy and find a refined estimate of the frequency as the
maximum of a quadratic interpolating polynomial fit to this bin and its two
neighbouring bins. This is a procedure documented in
\cite[p.~45]{serra1989system}. The interpolation is best performed in the
log-spectrum and on a spectrum produced using a window, such as a zero-padded
Hann window, giving a wide enough main-lobe so that the three points lie on this
lobe and not on side-lobes. A refined estimate of the amplitude of the sinusoid
is obtained with this procedure as well.

In the original paper by McAulay and Quatieri, they do not use this technique
but, as they show an example analysis of a speech signal, instead adjust the
analysis window to be a multiple of the period of the glottal pulse. The bins of
the DTFT used in the analysis will be integer multiples of the frequency given
as the reciprocal of this period. Under the model of the speech signal as
harmonically related sinusoids, the best estimate for the frequency is the bin
of a local maximum, its amplitude the modulus of the spectrum at this maximum, and
the phase the argument.

In our system, we use a fixed window size. To estimate the phase then we use
Equation~\ref{eq:ddmestc0} with
\[
    \gamma_{\text{MQ}}(n)=\exp(2\pi\frac{k^{\ast}}{M}n)
\]
where $k^{\ast}$ is the bin we have determined to correspond to the frequency of
the sinusoid. The inital phase is then $\Im \left\{ c_{0} \right\}$.

\subsubsection{The extended methods}

Two extended methods are evaluated: the cubic and quartic phase and amplitude polynomials
derived from DDM-estimated coefficients. For the polynomials of both orders, the
DDM is used exactly as described in Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepolyest} to estimate
the parameters. The difference is in how the interpolating polynomials are
formed between parameters estimated at two time points. For the cubic
polynomials, the interpolation method described in
Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepoly} is used for phase, while that in
Section~\ref{sec:cubicamppoly} is used for amplitude. For the quintic
polynomials the interpolation methods described in
Sections~\ref{sec:quinticphasepoly}~and~\ref{sec:quinticamppoly} are used for
phase and amplitude, respectively.

\subsection{Evaluation on sinusoid of cubic phase \label{sec:evalcubicphase}}

The initial evalutation illustrates how higher order phase polynomials will not
necessarily improve the quality of synthesis if the underlying phase function is
a polynomial of lower order than the polynomials used for synthesis. As we will
see, the estimated phase functions suffer from ``overfitting''.

The synthesized signal has 3 frequency break-points and an initial phase,
therefore its phase function can be interpolated by a cubic polynomial
\[
    x_{\phi}(n) = \exp \left(b_3 n^{3} + b_2 n^{2} + b_1 n + b_0 \right)
\]
the frequency break-points are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cubicsinphparams}. The
initial phase is $0$ radians.

\begin{table}
    \caption{\label{tab:cubicsinphparams}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|c c c}
            Time (seconds) & 0 & 0.25 & 0.5 \\
            Frequency (Hz) & 100 & 200 & 100
        \end{tabular}

\subsection{Evaluation on sinusoid of exponential phase \label{sec:evalexpphase}}

The previous evaluation of this analysis-synthesis system was on a sinusoid with
small order polynomial phase. In the cases where we observed overfitting, the
polynomial used for synthesis was of higher order than the true underlying one
--- the interpolating polynomials were more times differentiable than the true
polynomial. We propose evaluating the system on an infinitely differentiable and
analytic phase function. The rationale behind this stems from the definition of
an analytic function: one whose power series representation (a polynomial)
converges to the function as the number of terms approches infinity. What this
means is, in the region of convergence, the larger the number of terms in the
approximating polynomial, the better the approximation to the true underlying
function. The exponential function
\[
    y=\exp(x), x,y \in \mathbb{R}
\]
is one such function whose power series is
\[
    \exp(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n}}{n!}
\]
To find the radius of convergence, we use the ratio test
\[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{|1/n!|}{|1/(n+1)!|} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} n = \infty
\]
i.e., the power series of the exponential function converges everywhere and so
using more terms of its power series will improve its approximation for
any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

The exponential function arises in music. In 12-tone equal temperament tuning,
to find the frequency $f_{1}$ of a pitch $b$-semitones away from the frequency
$f_{0}$ we compute
\[
    f_{1}=f_{0}2^{\frac{b}{12}}=f_{0}\exp(\log(2)\frac{b}{12})
\]
So a linear transition from pitch $b_{0}$ to $b_{1}$ is an exponential change in
frequency. This could be observed in recordings of performances of the
\textit{portamento} gesture.

We synthesize a sinusoid  of length $N$ samples with exponential phase and use
the same analysis system as in Section~\ref{sec:evalcubicphase} to evaluate the
synthesis accuracy for piece-wise interpolating polynomials of cubic and quartic
order for phase. The signal $x$ is defined
\[
    x(n) = \exp(\frac{2\pi f_{0}}{\log(2)c_{1}}\exp(j(c_{1}n + c_{0})))
\]
with
\[
    c_{0} = \log(2)\frac{b_{0}}{12}
\]
and
\[
    c_{1}= \log(2)\frac{b_{1}}{12N}
\]
i.e., a signal starting at pitch $b_{0}$ with frequency $f_{0}$ and arriving at
pitch $b_{1}$ in $N$ samples. We keep the amplitude of the signal constant in
this evalutation as we are interested in the accuracy of the phase
reconstruction. The same proceduare as in
Section~\ref{sec:evalcubicphase} is used to estimate the parameters of
piece-wise interpolating phase polynomials. We can see in
Figure~\ref{plot:mqexperrortruevsesterr} that the resynthesis accuracy is
greater for higher order polynomials. Spectrograms of the original and estimated
signals are plotted in Figure~\ref{plot:mqexperrorallspect}.

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Polynomial phase function}

Out of the three proposed methods it appears that the modified cubic
interpolation method works superiorly for the signal model considered. We obseve
overfitting by the higher-order quintic model in
Figure~\ref{plot:mqmoderrcomplogampfunc}, compromising the accuracy of
resynthesis.  Even the proposed cubic model shows some overfitting in this case.
This is consistent with the results of \cite{girin2003comparing}. From
Figure~\ref{plot:mqmoderrcompphaseerr} it is clear that the DDM based methods
provide superior estimation of the phase function --- this is not the case for
the log-amplitude function. Depending on the underlying signal, perhaps better
results can be obtained by postulating a lower-order amplitude function and
higher-order phase function. The possibility of errors arising from numerical
accuracy when evaluating the quintic polynomials has been ruled out.  We
evalutated these polynomials using an implementation of Horner's method that
keeps track of the error bound \cite[p.~95]{higham2002accuracy}: the errors are
negligible, see Figure~\ref{plot:mqmodquinticpolyevalerr} for the results.

\subsection{Exponential phase function}

The quintic interpolation, the polynomial of highest order, performs the most
accurate resynthesis. This is consistent with the analytic property of the
exponential function and an encouraging result as it suggests arbitrary analytic
phase functions can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy simply by increasing
the order of the interpolating polynomials. Many models of musical gestures
involve such functions, apart from the portamento gesture modeled by an
exponential phase function, vibrato can be modeled as a sinusoid with sinusoidal
phase \cite{maher1990investigation}. The DDM-based analysis system combined with
the higher order polynomial phase synthesis system presented here allow for
accurate modeling of these gestures.
