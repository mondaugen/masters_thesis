\chapter{The normal distribution\label{chap:normaldist}}

If a random variable $X$ is has mean $\mu = E(X)$ and variance $\sigma^{2} =
E((X-\mu)^{2})$, where $E$ is the expectation operator, and is completely
described by these two parameters, we say that draws from $X$, $x$, follow a
normal distribution. Put another way, given a draw $x$ from $X$, the probability of
obtaining $x$ for is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{p}_{\mathcal{N}}(x)
    =
    \mathcal{N}(x;\mu,\sigma)
    =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\exp(-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}})
\end{equation}
When a random variable $X$ is distributed by a normal distribution with mean $\mu$
and variance $\sigma^{2}$ we write
\[
    X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)
\]
The normal distribution arises often in statistics in signal processing due to
the \textit{Central Limit Theorem} \cite{feller2008introduction} and its
relationship to least-squares estimation \cite{kay1993fundamentals}.
