\section*{Acknowledgments}
My time at McGill University has been a long one, so I have many people to
thank.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Philippe Depalle for his
mentorship, support, and patience during the writing of this thesis, especially
during the final months. He has a tremendous talent for understanding and
organizing thought. I would not have been able to produce a document of this
quality without his help.

I am grateful to Professor Gary Scavone both for the teaching assistance
opportunities he granted me and for inspiring me in those first courses I took
with him to further pursue Music Technology. I thank Professor Ichiro Fujinaga
and Professor Stephen McAdams for the opportunities they provided to work on
Music Technology projects, furthering my training in information technology and
signal processing.

Much of my interest in music technology and signal processing was awoken by
my colleague and friend, Scott Monk, to whom I express much gratitude.

Finally I would like to thank my parents, Denise and Rob Esterer, for their
encouragement in all my endeavours.

Thank you all.
