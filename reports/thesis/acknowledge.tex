\section*{Acknowledgements}
My time at McGill University has been a long one, so I have many people to thank.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Philippe Depalle for his mentorship,
support, and patience during the writing of this thesis, especially during the
final months. He has a tremendous talent at understanding and organizing
thought. I would not have been able to produce a document of this quality
without his help.

I am grateful to Professor Gary Scavone both for the teaching assistance
opportunities he offered me and for inspiring me in those first courses I took
with him to further pursue Music Technology. I thank Professor Ichiro Fujinaga
and Professor Stephen McAdams for the opportunities they provided to work on
Music Technology projects, furthering my training in information technology and
signal processing.
