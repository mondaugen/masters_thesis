\chapter{Experiment: Separation of two sources using partial decay rate
\label{chap:decaysep}}

In this section we demonstrate how the techniques described above can be used to
perform audio source separation. We start with a recording of an acoustic guitar
playing $a_{3}$ and a xylophone playing $f_{4}^{\sharp}$. The recordings are
from \cite{opolko1987mcgill} and have been mixed down to one channel (by simply
adding the two signals together) and resampled at 16 KHz, coded simply as a
stream of 64-bit floating-point numbers. Spectrograms of the original signals are
shown in Figure~\ref{plot:acgtra3specgram} and
Figure~\ref{plot:xylofs4specgram}. The spectrograms were produced with a
Hann window, DFT size of 4096 samples and a hop size of 512 samples.

The mixture of the two signals was analysed using the DDM for finding the
coefficients of a cubic complex phase polynomial. Local maxima in each frame
were found using the technique described in \cite[p.~42]{serra1989system}. For
each of these local maxima, the polynomial coefficients were estimated. The
analysis used the $\mathcal{C}^{1}$ 4-Term Blackman-Harris window. To obtain
partials it was then necessary to connect the local maxima. As the partials of
these two sound sources are quite stable in frequency it sufficed to use the
Viterbi algorithm \cite{forney1973viterbi} to connect local maxima in sub-bands
of the spectrum. The cost function is simply the Euclidean distance between the
frequencies of two local maxima. Partial starting points are considered in
sub-bands of width 15 Hz and these sub-bands overlap by 7.5 Hz. A partial path
starts on the first local maximum in the band exceeding -100 dB and ends at the
last maximum exceeding -100 dB. The path search algorithm will also look ahead
to further frames if no maximum is present in the next frame. Because of this,
sometimes unrealistic paths are discovered that jump between spurious maxima.
These are filtered out by discarding paths whose cost-length ratio is excessive.
See Figure~\ref{plot:acgtra3xylofs4costlengththresh} to see a plot of these
values and the thresholding function.

The spectrogram of
the mixture can be seen in Figure~\ref{plot:acgtra3xylofs4specgram} and the
partial paths in Figure~\ref{plot:acgtra3xylofs4partials}.

A line function is fit via least-squares to each partial, as shown in
Figure~\ref{plot:parclassaxpartialtrajectories}. Our goal is to classify based
on the amplitude modulation of each partial, or to an approximation, the slope of these line-functions. We found that examining the log-length of the
partials gives better results than examining the slope directly. This is perhaps
because the log-length encodes both the starting amplitude and the slope---recall
that the partials start on the first local maxium exceeding an amplitude
threshold. To motivate the use of this metric, we plot the log-length vs. the
starting frequency of
partials from separate analyses of the guitar and xlyophone signals and overlay
the plots (Figure~\ref{plot:partialclassificationacgtrxyloseptruememberships}).
The data-points have the form
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}_i = \begin{pmatrix}
        a_{i,0} \\
        a_{i,1}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
where $a_{i,0}$ is the first PC and $a_{i,1}$ the second. The set of PC data
points will be denoted $\{\boldsymbol{a}\}$.

\end{figure}
We see that, for the most part, the partials belonging to the two sources are
separated appropriately into two clusters. The partials from the xylophone
present in the guitar cluster belong to higher partials, whose omission in the
final rendering of the xylophone source would not be detrimental to its
perceptual quality. Similarly, partials belonging to the guitar present in the
xylophone cluster are short and most likely belong to briefly excited modes
of the guitar body. Our intention is now to use GMM on a set of unclassified
partials to yield a plausible source separation.

GMM fitting is sensitive to its initial guess of the parameters as the algorithm
only finds a local maximum of the likelihood function
\cite[p.~187]{kay1993fundamentals}.

To find an initial guess we convolve the scatter plot with Gaussian kernels,
giving a continuous function. We use the two local maxima of this function as
the initial means for the two sought classifying Gaussian distributions. The
convolution function evalutated at $\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}$ is
\[
    f(\boldsymbol{\hat{a}}) = \sum_{\boldsymbol{a}_i \in \{\boldsymbol{a}\}}
    \mathcal{N} \left( \boldsymbol{\hat{a}} ; \boldsymbol{a}_i,
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{a}} \right)
\]
%(see
%Appendix~\ref{apdx:gaussian_dist} for the definition of $\mathcal{N} \left(
%    \boldsymbol{x} ; \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \right)$)
(see
Appendix~\ref{apdx:gaussian_dist} for the definition of $\mathcal{N}$).
To make the variance proportial to the extent of each dimension,
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{a}}$ is defined as
\[
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\boldsymbol{a}}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_1}}{\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_0
        +\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_1}}}
            \theta_{\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}}}}
        & 0 \\
        0 & \frac{\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_0}}{\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_0
    +\Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_1}}}
            \theta_{\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}}}}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
where
\[
    \Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_0} = \max \left( \boldsymbol{a}_0 \right)
        - \min \left( \boldsymbol{a}_0 \right)
\]
\[
    \Delta_{\boldsymbol{a}_1} = \max \left( \boldsymbol{a}_1 \right)
        - \min \left( \boldsymbol{a}_1 \right)
\]
and $\theta_{\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}}}}$ is a parameter to control
the smoothness of the resulting function, here
$\theta_{\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}}}} = 1.2$. A contour plot of the
resulting function is shown in
Figure~\ref{plot:partialclassificationacgtrxylosepestimatedmemberships}.

To initialize GMM the initial means $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{0}$ are chosen to be the
points corresponding to the local maxima of the smoothed scatter plot. To
determine initial weights $\boldsymbol{w}^{0}$ we first determine the value of
the function at the two local maxima, $f(\boldsymbol{a}_{0}^{\ast})$ and
$f(\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{\ast})$. To weight relative to these two values, we
compute
\[
    w_{i}^{0} = \frac{\Theta_{w} \left\{ f(\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\ast}) \right\}}{
    \sum_{p=0}^{P-1}\Theta_{w} \left\{ f(\boldsymbol{a}_{p}^{\ast} \right\}}
\]
where $\Theta_{w}$ is some kind of weighting operator to have parametric control
over the influence of each function value. Here
\[
    \Theta_{w} \left\{ f(\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\ast}) \right\}
    = \begin{cases}
        f(\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\ast}) \theta_{w} & i = 0 \\
        f(\boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\ast}) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
and $P = 2$. For this experiment the parameter set as $\theta_{w} = 1.1$ gave
the best results. The covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma^{0}}$ is computed as
\[
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma^{0}} = \boldsymbol{S}(\{ \boldsymbol{a} \}) +
    \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\]
where $\boldsymbol{S}$ computes the sample covariance and
$\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is some small constant to avoid a singular initial covariance
matrix. 100 iterations of the EM algorithm are performed to compute
classifications. Each point is assigned to its most likely cluster using the
final estimated Gaussian distributions. The final classifications for this
classification task can be seen in
Figure~\ref{plot:partialclassificationacgtrxylosepestimatedmemberships}.

\end{figure}

After the classifications have been made, synthesizing the separated sources
simply involves only synthesizing the partials classified as belonging to the
same source. For the synthesis, we use the technique described in
Section~\label{sec:cubicphasepoly}. Spectrograms of the source separated signals
are shown in Figure~\ref{plot:acgtra3specgramss} and
Figure~\ref{plot:xylofs4specgramss}.

\subsection{Conclusion}

After an informal listening, the
source separation is perceptually convincing.\footnote{Soundfiles can be
downloaded from \par

At least one partial from the guitar can be heard in the xylophone recording,
however --
it is difficult to separate partials that do not have sufficient spacial separation in
Figure~\ref{plot:partialclassificationacgtrxylosepestimatedmemberships}. Another drawback of the current technique is that it requires some
tuning of the parameters $\theta_{w}$ and
$\theta_{\boldsymbol{\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}}}}$. Furthermore, some of the
partials from both sounds were lost in the analysis. Although a shortcoming of
the analysis rather than the classification, if partials are not sufficiently
separated in time or frequency, they cannot be separated as their analysis will
yield simply one partial when there in fact many. In any case, it is important
to see that source separation can be carried out by only considering the
amplitude modulation (in this case, the decay rate) in relation to the partial
frequency---the techniques discussed in Section~\ref{sec:previoussstechniques}
use fundamental frequency estimation or harmonicity assumptions in their models.
