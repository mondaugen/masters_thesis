\section{Introduction}
In signal processing, a common task is the separation of a signal with known
deterministic or statistical characteristics from another. This task has been
well studied \cite{kay1993fundamentals} \cite{hayes2009statistical}
\cite{poor2013introduction} and works well for problems of digital communication
or object detection where these characteristics are well known. In digital
communication, the signals and techniques to transmit them are often optimized
by the designer to make them robust to corruption or interference. The designers
of vehicles usually design them to be predictable and reliable and so their
positions in time will reflect this. In this thesis we tacle a more difficult
problem, that of the separation of a mixture of acoustic signals. The nature of
these signals is different in that their design criteria are either
mostly unknown or fundamentally different. For example, musical instruments are
designed to have desirable acoustic properties which are generally subjective.
As an example of one of the complications, the choirs of the orchestra are sets
of instruments actually designed to blend well; to sound as one instrument.
Ironically, it is this criterion that we use to guide the source separation
techniques described in the following.

\section{Methodology}
Perceptual studies have shown that sounds modulated synchronously in amplitude
or frequency are heard as one sound, whereas asynchronously modulated sounds are
heard as distinct \cite{mcadams1989segregation} \cite{marin1991segregation}.
Here we define the modulation of parameters $\theta_i$ and $\theta_j$ as being
synchronous if they are given as functions of time, $\theta_i=f_i(t)$ and
$\theta_j=f_j(t)$ and there is an affine transform $\mathscr{A}$ such that
$\mathscr{A}\{f_i\}(t) \approx A f_j(t) + B$ where $A$ and $B$ are constants
that do not vary with time (at least for the time that we observe the signal).
If we can accurately measure these parameters and they are typical of the sounds
we are trying to separate, then we can design techniques to reliably separate
these sounds from acoustic mixtures. This involves picking those parameters
classified as belonging to the same sound, discarding the rest, and
resynthesizing from these parameters. The task of audio source separation
therefore comprises the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Decide on a signal model for the sound of interest, with parameters that
        can be estimated and that are similar for similar sounds.
    \item
        Estimate the signal parameters.
    \item
        Classify the parameters and group them as sets of parameters coming from
        the same source: the sound of interest.
    \item
        Choose a group of parameters and synthesize the separated signal from
        them.
\end{itemize}

This thesis describes various approaches to the above tasks and utilises some of
them in source separation experiments.

\section{Signal Modeling}

\subsection{Time-Frequency Representations}

As most musical instruments are resonating media and excited resonating media
are well described as linear time-invariant (LTI) auto-regressive (AR)
structures, popular models of musical audio are some variation of this
description.
% Need citation

An LTI auto-regressive structure is a signal that can be desribed using the
following \textit{difference equation}:

\begin{equation}
    x(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} a_k x(n-k) + b_0 v(n)
\end{equation}

Here $x$ is the output of the system (what is heard or measured) and $v$ is the
input. $K$ is the order of the model. Both are general functions of time which,
in the case of properly sampled digital audio, can be considered at times $n \in
\mathbb{Z}$ without any loss of information. $a_k,b_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ and are
constants. Casually (no pun intended) you can think of the output of the system
at time $n$ as being a linear combination of past outputs, plus some of the
scaled input.

AR structures are excited in various ways: some are bowed, others struck, etc.
To characterize the above structure we excite it with a simple signal, the
\textit{delta function}

\begin{equation}
    \delta(n) = \begin{cases}
        1 & n=0\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This delta function input will yield its \textit{impulse
response} from which we can derive many properties of the AR structure.

As an example take the case where $K=1$ and $a_1 = r \exp(j\omega)$, 
$r\text{,}\omega \in \mathbb{R}$, $|r|<1$ (recall that $j=\sqrt{-1}$ and is
called the \textit{imaginary number}). Then the difference equation is

\begin{equation}
    x(n) = r \exp(j\omega) x(n-1) + v(n)
\end{equation}

Exciting this with the delta function we get
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{c}
        x(0) = 1 \\
        x(1) = r \exp(j\omega) \\
        x(n) = r^n \exp(j\omega n)
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

which is a complex exponential starting at $n=0$ and periodic in
$n_T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ multiplied by the real-valued
exponential $r^n$. In other words, the output is a damped exponential. From this
it is not hard to see that if we can estimate the coefficients $a_k$, we can
then know the frequencies, amplitudes and damping factors of the sinusoids that
are output when this structure is excited by an impulse (the delta function).
This technique is presented as a motivation for the following techniques and is
not pursued here. The interested reader is referred to \cite{makhoul1975linear}
for more information.

An alternative method for determining the frequencies and amplitudes of
sinusoids in mixture is to take the inner-product of the signal with a complex
exponential of known frequency and see what you get

\begin{equation}
    X(\omega) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(n) \exp(-j \omega n)
\end{equation}

The function $X(\omega)$ will be large if $x(n)$ contains a complex exponential of
frequency $\omega$ and small if it doesn't, effectively indicating which
sinusoidal functions are present in the signal. This transformation of a signal
as a function of time $n$ into one as a function of frequency $\omega$ is known
as the \textit{Discrete-time Fourier Transform} (DTFT). 

To create a variety of pitches and timbres, typically the media of musical
instruments are not static, but vary in time. That means the sets of sinusoids
describing the state of the media and its excitation also change in time. To
account for this we consider many small intervals of signal where we assume its
characteristics are roughly static. We can then piece these time-intervals
together afterwards to get a description of the signal in both time and
frequency. To do this, we multiply the signal by a window $w$ which makes the signal
0 outside of the interval of interest. We then test what sinusoids with
frequencies $\omega$ are present at different times $\tau$, giving a function of
two variables

\begin{equation}
    X(\tau,\omega) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(n) w(n - \tau) \exp(-j \omega n)
\end{equation}

This transformation of a signal of time $n$ in to one of time $\tau$ and
frequency $\omega$ is known as the \textit{Discrete-time Short-time Fourier
Transform} (DTSTFT).

\subsection{Polynomial Phase Models}

The DTFT and DTSTFT are very useful because they are invertible
\cite{portnoff1976implementation} and fast algorithms exist for their 
computation by digital computer \cite{van1992computational}. If the presence of
a sinusoid is determined, e.g., by finding $\tau^{\ast}$ and $\omega^{\ast}$ such that
$X$ is maximized, that signal can be removed or altered easily.

One drawback of these transforms is they only project onto sinusoidal functions
of linear phase, i.e., functions of constant frequency. In general, musical
signals are not linear combinations of sinusoids of constant frequency
(consider, for example, vibrato). We could decide to project onto a different
family of functions and considerable effort has been devoted to finding
alternatives (see \cite{kereliuk2011sparse} for a review). In the case of
musical signals, however, we have some prior information and can make certain
assumptions about the underlying functions.

\subsubsection{Sinusoidal Representations}
\label{sec:mqfmfromphase}
Many musical acoustic signals are quasi-harmonic, meaning that they consist of a
sum of sinusoids whose frequencies are roughly integer multiples of a
fundamental frequency. For these kinds of signals, most of the energy can be
attributed to sinusoids and so, if we neglect the noisy part of the signal, the
signal can be described by a small number of sinusoids with slowly varying
amplitude and phase, plus some noise. The model is

\begin{equation}
    x(n)=\sum_{p=1}^{P} A_p(n) \exp(j \phi_p(n)) + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

where $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ and $A_p \in \mathbb{R}$ and
$\phi_p \in \mathbb{R}$ are functions of amplitude and phase respectively. In the
following, we consider equivalent sinusoidal mixtures of complex-valued
polynomial phase exponentials
\begin{equation}
    x(n)=\sum_{p=1}^{P} \exp(\mathcal{P}_p(n)) + \varepsilon
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{P}_p(n) = \sum_{q=0}^{Q} c_q n^{q}
\end{equation}

and $c_q \in \mathbb{C}$.

The sum-of-sinusoids model of McAulay and Quatieri estimates these coefficients
in an indirect way \cite{mcaulay1986speech}. Given two local maxima of the
DTSTFT $X(\tau_0,\omega_0)$ and $X(\tau_1,\omega_1)$, where $H = \tau_1 -
\tau_0$ we can conjecture a cubic
polynomial phase function for the imaginary part of the phase argument

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\phi}(n) = c_3 (n-\tau_0)^3 + c_2 (n-\tau_0)^2 + c_1 (n-\tau_0) + c_0
\end{equation}

By noting that we have 2 measurements of the phase and frequency,
$\angle\{X(\tau_0,\omega_0)\}$ and $\angle\{X(\tau_1,\omega_1)\}$, and the frequency
is the derivative of the phase, we can solve for the coefficients of the
polynomial phase function using the following linear system of equations
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0   & 0     & 0 & 1 \\
        H^3 & H^2   & H & 1 \\
        0   & 0     & 1 & 0 \\
        3 H^2 & 2 H & 1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Im\{c_3\} \\
        \Im\{c_2\} \\
        \Im\{c_1\} \\
        \Im\{c_0\}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \angle\{X(\tau_0,\omega_0)\} \\
        \angle\{X(\tau_1,\omega_1)\} + 2 \pi M \\
        \omega_0 \\
        \omega_1        
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and choosing $M$ so that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:minfmmq}
    \int_{0}^{H}(\tilde{\phi}^{\prime\prime}(t))^{2}dt
\end{equation}
is minimized.

As only two measurements of the amplitude of the sinusoid are available,
$|X(\tau_0,\omega_0)|$ and $|X(\tau_1,\omega_1)|$, the coefficients
$c_3$ and $c_2$ are purely imaginary and the real parts of $c_1$ and $c_0$ are
determined as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 \\
        H & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re\{c_1\} \\
        \Re\{C_0\}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \log(|X(\tau_0,\omega_0)|) \\
        \log(|X(\tau_1,\omega_1)|)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Polynomial phase parameter estimation}
\label{sec:ddm_description}
More recently a set of techniques have been developed that use some combination
of derivatives of the analysis window $w$ or the signal $x$ to estimate the
polynomial coefficients directly \cite{hamilton2011non}. For this thesis we will
only consider a technique that does not estimate derivatives of the signal and
only requires a once-differentiable analysis window as it is relatively easy to
implement and suits our purposes.

The following is adapted from \cite{betser2009sinusoidal}. Consider the inner
product of the signal $x(n) = \exp(\mathcal{P}_p(n)) $ and a
known analysis \textit{atom} $\psi(n)$
\[
    f(n) = \left\langle x,\psi \right\rangle =
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(n)\overline{\psi}(n)dn
\]
Differentiating with respect to $n$ we obtain
\[
    \frac{df}{dn}(n) = \frac{dx}{dn}(n)\overline{\psi}(n)
    + x(n)\frac{d\overline{\psi}}{dn}(n)
    = \left( \sum_{q=1}^{Q} q c_q n^{q-1} \right) x(n)\overline{\psi}(n)
    + x(n)\frac{d\overline{\psi}}{dn}(n)
\]

If $\psi(t)$ is 0 outside of some interval $n \in [-T,T]$ then
\[
    \int_{-T}^{T} \frac{dx}{dn}(n)\overline{\psi}(n) dn
    = \sum_{q=1}^{Q} q c_q \int_{-T}^{T} n^{q-1} x(n) \overline{\psi}(n) dn
    + \left\langle x, \frac{d\overline{\psi}}{dn} \right\rangle = 0
\]
which after rearranging is
\[ 
    \sum_{q=1}^{Q} q c_q 
    \left\langle n^{q-1} x(n) , \overline{\psi}(n) dn \right\rangle
    = -\left\langle x, \frac{d\overline{\psi}}{dn} \right\rangle
\]
From this we can see that to estimate the coefficients $c_q$, $ 1 \leq q \leq Q
$ we simply need $R$ atoms with $R \geq Q$ to solve the linear system of
equations
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ddmsyseq}
    \sum_{q=1}^{Q} q c_q 
    \left\langle n^{q-1} x(n) , \overline{\psi_{r}}(n) dn \right\rangle
    = -\left\langle x, \frac{d\overline{\psi_{r}}}{dn} \right\rangle
\end{equation}
for $1 \leq r \leq R$. To estimate $c_0$ we write the signal we are analysing as
\[
    s(n) = \exp(c_0) \exp \left( \sum_{q=1}^{Q} c_q n^{q} \right) + \eta (n)
\]
$\eta (n)$ is the error signal, or the part of the signal that is not explained
by our model. We also define the function $\gamma (n)$, the part of the signal
whose coefficients have already been estimated
\[
    \gamma(n) = \exp \left( \sum_{q=1}^{Q} c_q n^{q} \right)
\]
Computing the inner-product $\left\langle s , \gamma \right\rangle$, we have
\[
    \left\langle s , \gamma \right\rangle
    =
    \left\langle \exp(c_0) \gamma , \gamma \right\rangle + 
        \left\langle \eta , \gamma \right\rangle
\]
The inner-product between $\eta$ and $\gamma$ is $0$, by the orthogonality
principle \cite{kay1993fundamentals}. Furthermore, because $\exp(c_0)$ does not
depend on $n$, we have
\[
    \left\langle s , \gamma \right\rangle
    =
    \exp(c_0) \left\langle \gamma , \gamma \right\rangle
\]
so we can estimate $c_0$ as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ddmestc0}
    c_0 = \log \left( \left\langle s , \gamma \right\rangle \right)
        - \log \left( \left\langle \gamma , \gamma \right\rangle \right)
\end{equation}
The estimation of the coefficients of a phase polynomial
using this method is known as the \textit{Distribution Derivative Method (DDM)}.

\subsubsection{The choice of atom $\psi$ \label{sec:optblackman}}

As we are dealing with mixtures of sinusoids of small bandwidth, in addition to
the finite time support constraint, we desire atoms whose inner-product is only
significant within a finite bandwidth of interest. To construct these atoms, we
multiply the Fourier atom by the window $w$
\[
    \psi_{\tau,\omega}^{\mathcal{F}_{w}}(n) = w(n-\tau) \exp(-j\omega(n-\tau))
\]

A good overview of different windows and their properties is given in
\cite{harris1978use}. We require that the window be at least
once-differentiable and zero outside of a certain interval, therefore, somewhat
informally, we require
\[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow T} \psi(n) = \psi(T) = 0
\]
The \textit{Hann} window possesses this property
\[
    w_{h}(n) = \begin{cases}
        0.5 + 0.5 \cos \left( \frac{n}{T}\pi \right) & -T \leq n \leq T \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]

The Hann window is a member of a class of windows constructed by summing scaled
harmonically related cosine functions, subject to the constraint that the
scaling coefficients sum to 1 so that the window have a value of 1 at $n=0$.
Letting $T=N/2$, where $N$ is the length of the window
\[
    w(n) = \begin{cases}
        \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}a_{m}\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{N}mn \right) & -\frac{N}{2} \leq n
        \leq \frac{N}{2} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
With $M=2$ and $a_0 = a_1 = 0.5$, we have the Hann window. The
\textit{Blackman-Harris} family of windows are also sum-of-cosine windows. For
these windows, optimization techniques were used to search for coefficients
giving optimum properties, such as minimum height of the highest side-lobe
(maximum out-of-band rejection) \cite{rabiner1970approach}. The 4-term window
whose coefficients $a$ are listed in table~\ref{tab:optblackman} has a maximum
side-lobe level of 92 dB, lower than the quantization noise of a 16-bit linear
pulse code modulated signal. This window has a very large main-lobe which means
two sinusoids of similar frequency will be difficult to resolve. Furthermore,
the window has a discontinuity at its boundaries, e.g.,
$w \left( \frac{N}{2} \right) \neq 0$ and is not once-differentiable. In any
case the window is valuble in that it essentially nulls any influence of signals
outside of a bandwidth of interest.

To find a window with properties similar to the 4-term Blackman-Harris window
but without a discontinuity, we solve the optimization problem
\[
        \min||a-\tilde{a}||_2 \\
\]
subject to
\[
        w_{\tilde{a}} \left( \frac{N}{2} \right)
            = w_{\tilde{a}} \left( \frac{-N}{2} \right) = 0
\]
\[
        \sum_{m}^{M-1} a_{m} = 1
\]
where
\[
    w_{\tilde{a}}(n) = \begin{cases}
        \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}\tilde{a}_{m}\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{N}mn \right) & -\frac{N}{2} \leq n
        \leq \frac{N}{2} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
The solution $\tilde{a}^{\ast}$ is given in Table~\ref{tab:optblackman} and
plots are given in Figure~\ref{plot:optblackman}. This window will be referred
to as the $\mathcal{C}^{1}$ 4-Term Blackman-Harris window.

\subsection{\label{sec:partialtracking}Partial Tracking}

In Section~\ref{sec:mqfmfromphase} we discussed how to determine reasonable
values for the coefficients of a cubic phase polynomial by using the frequency,
phase and time difference of two local maxima in the DTSTFT. In this section we
discuss possible ways of determining which local maxima are connected. This is
referred to as \textit{peak matching} \cite{mcaulay1986speech}
or \textit{partial tracking} \cite{smith1987parshl} \cite{depalle1993tracking}.

\subsubsection{A Greedy Method}

The original method of connecting peaks in the spectrogram is from
\cite{mcaulay1986speech}. This method is simple and fast but, as we will see,
can be sensitive to spurious peaks.

Typically the DTSTFT is computed for a block of contiguous samples, called a
\textit{frame} and these frames are computed every $H$ samples, $H$ being the
\textit{hop-size}. Consider the parameters of local maxima in adjacent frames
$k$ and $k+1$ with $M$ maxima in frame $k$ and $N$ maxima in frame $k+1$. In
\cite{mcaulay1986speech}  the parameters are the instantaneous amplitude, phase
and frequency and are indexed by frequency as $\omega_0^{k}, \dotsc,
\omega_{M-1}^{k}$ and $\omega_0^{k+1}, \dotsc, \omega_{N-1}^{k+1}$, but here we
allow for an arbitrary set of parameters $\theta_0^{k}, \dotsc,
\theta_{M-1}^{k}$ and $\theta_0^{k+1}, \dotsc,
\theta_{N-1}^{k+1}$, such as the coefficients of a phase polynomial. Define a
distance function $\mathcal{D} \left( \theta_{i},\theta_{j} \right)$ that computes the
similarity between two sets of parameters. We will now consider a method that
finds $L$ pairs of parameters that are closest.

We compute the cost matrix $C$
\[
    C = \theta^{k} \otimes_{\mathcal{D}} \theta^{k+1}
\]
so that the $i$th row and $j$th column contain $C_{i,j} = \mathcal{D} \left(
\theta_{i}^{k},\theta_{j}^{k+1} \right)$.  For each $l \in \left[0 \dotsc L-1
\right]$, find the indices $i_{l}$ and $j_{l}$ corresponding to the shortest
distance, then remove the $i_{l}$th row and $j_{l}$th column from consideration
and continue until $L$ pairs have been determined or the distances exceed some
threshold $\Delta$. This is summarized in Algorithm~\ref{alg:mq_peak_match}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{\label{alg:mq_peak_match}}
    \KwIn{the cost matrix $C$}
    \KwOut{$L$ index pairs $\Gamma_{i}$ and $\Gamma_{j}$}
    $\Gamma_{i} \leftarrow \varnothing$\;
    $\Gamma_{j} \leftarrow \varnothing$\;
    \For{$l \leftarrow 0$ to $L-1$}{
        $i_{l},j_{l}=\argmin_{i \in \left[ 0,\dotsc,M-1 \right] \setminus
        \Gamma_{i}, j \in \left[ 0,\dotsc,M-1 \right] \setminus \Gamma_{j}}
        C_{i,j}$\;
        \If{$ C_{i_{l},j_{l}} > \Delta$}{
            \KwRet{$\Gamma_{i},\Gamma_{j}$}
        }
        $\Gamma_{i} \leftarrow \Gamma{i} \cup i_{l}$\;
        $\Gamma_{j} \leftarrow \Gamma{i} \cup j_{l}$\;
    }
    \KwRet{$\Gamma_{i},\Gamma_{j}$}
\end{algorithm}

This is a greedy algorithm because on every iteration the smallest cost is
identified and its indices are removed from consideration. Perhaps choosing a
slightly higher cost in one iteration would allow smaller costs to be chosen in
successive iterations. This algorithm does not allow for that. In other terms,
the algorithm does not find a set of pairs that represent a globally minimal sum of
costs.
Another drawback of the algorithm is that it only works between two sucessive
frames. The cost function could be extended to consider $K$ sets of parameters,
constructing an $K$-dimensional tensor instead of a matrix, but assuming equal
numbers of parameter sets in all frames, the search space would grow exponentially
with $K$. Nevertheless, the method is simple to implement, computationally
negligble, and works well with a variety of signals encountered in audio
\cite{mcaulay1986speech} \cite{smith1987parshl}.

\subsubsection{An Optimal Method}

There is a way to find a set of paths over multiple frames ($K > 2$) having the
lowest total cost if
we restrict the search to exactly $L$ paths. Instead of indexing parameters by
their frame number $k$, we make $k$ part of the parameter set so that it can be
used by the distance function $\mathcal{D}$. Assume that over $K$ frames there
are $M$ total parameter sets. We define the vector $\boldsymbol{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{M^2}$
where the entry $\boldsymbol{c}_{i + Mj} = \mathcal{D} \left( \theta_{i}, \theta_{j}
\right)$. If we have a set of connections $\Gamma_{i,j}$ we can calculate the
total cost of these connections by defining the vector
\[
    \boldsymbol{x}_{i + Mj} = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{there is a connection between }i\text{ and }j\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
and then forming the inner product
\[
    c_{\text{total}}=\boldsymbol{c}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}
\]
Note that a node cannot be connected to itself. The question is how to find
$\boldsymbol{x}^{\ast}$ so that $c_{\text{total}}$ is minimized. If no
constraints are placed on $\boldsymbol{x}$, the solution is trivial, but not
useful. How do we constrain $\boldsymbol{x}$ to give us a solution to the
partial tracking problem? Let us consider an example.

In Figure~\ref{plot:simple_graph} we have an example of a simple graph or
lattice. The numbers are indices of nodes in the graph and the possible
connections between them are indicated by lines, or \textit{edges}. We would like to find the two
shortest paths based on different criteria. In
Figure~\ref{plot:simple_graph_greedy_paths} we find the paths using an algorithm
similar to Algorithm~\ref{alg:mq_peak_match} but search instead over a tensor
of distances $C \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 4 \times 2}$ whose entry $C_{i,j,k}$
represents the cost of travelling on the path connecting the $i$th node in layer
0, the $j$th node in layer 1 and the $k$th node in layer 2. This is the greedy
method of searching for the best paths whose optimality criterion is to find the
set of best paths containing the absolute best path. We see in
Figure~\ref{plot:simple_graph_greedy_paths} that the absolute shortest path, $1
\rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 8$, is discovered, followed by the second shortest
path not using the nodes of the first path.

\begin{figure}
    \caption{\label{plot:simple_graph}}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/small_graph_ex.eps}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \caption{\label{plot:simple_graph_greedy_paths}}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/small_graph_ex_greedy_paths.eps}
\end{figure}

To find a set of paths minimizing the total cost, we instead search for total
solutions $\boldsymbol{x}$ that describe all paths in the graph. Assume for now
that we can guarantee that the entries of $\boldsymbol{x}$ will be either 0 or
1. To find a set of constraints for our search, we consider the structure of a
valid solution $\boldsymbol{x}^{\ast}$. To maintain that paths not overlap, a
valid solution's nodes are only allowed to have one edge entering \textemdash
coming from a node in a previous frame \textemdash and one edge leaving
\textemdash going to a node in a successive frame. To translate this into a
constraint, consider the node $i$ and its possible $R$ successive connecting
nodes $j_{0} \dotsc j_{R-1}$. Define the vector
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}^{s,i}_{i + Mj_{r}} \begin{cases}
        1 & \forall j_{r} \in \left[ j_{0} \dotsc j_{R-1} \right] \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
As all the entries of $\boldsymbol{x}$ are either 0 or 1, we have
\[
    0 \leq \left\langle \boldsymbol{a}^{s,i}, \boldsymbol{x} \right\rangle \leq 1
\]
so we can make this a constraint to ensure that a node has at most one path
leaving. Similarly, if we consider the node $j$ and its possible R previous connecting
nodes $i_{0} \dotsc i_{R-1}$, the vector
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}^{p,j}_{i_{r} + Mj} \begin{cases}
        1 & \forall i_{r} \in \left[ i_{0} \dotsc i_{R-1} \right] \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]
constrains that node $j$ have only one path entering through the constraint
\[
    0 \leq \left\langle \boldsymbol{a}^{p,j} , \boldsymbol{x} \right\rangle \leq 1
\]
A node on a path will also have an edge entering and an edge leaving. To
translate this into a constraint, we define a vector that counts the number of
edges entering a node and subtracts then the number of edges leaving a node. The
result should always be 0. If $r$ is the index of the node considered, the vector is simply
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}^{b,r} = \boldsymbol{a}^{p,r} - \boldsymbol{a}^{s,r}
\]
and the constraint
\[
    \left\langle \boldsymbol{a}^{b,r}, \boldsymbol{x} \right\rangle = 0
\]
Finally we want to constrain that there be only $L$ paths. We do this by
noticing that if this is true, there will be $L$ edges between frames $k$ and
$k+1$. We constrain the number of paths going from edges
$\Gamma_{k}$ in frame $k$ to $\Gamma_{k+1}$ by forming the vector
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}^{c,k} = \sum_{j \in \Gamma_{k}} \boldsymbol{a}^{s,j}
\]
and asserting the constraint
\[
    \left\langle \boldsymbol{a}^{c,k} , \boldsymbol{x} \right\rangle = 1
\]
The length of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is $M^{2}$ so the total size of all the
constraints is not insignificant, but most entries in the constraint vectors will
be 0 and therefore the resulting constraint matrices very sparse, so sparse
linear algebra routines can be used in computations. Furthermore, the
$\boldsymbol{a}^{b}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}^{c}$ constraints are derived from
$\boldsymbol{a}^{p}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}^{s}$, so only the latter need to be
stored.

The complete \textit{linear program (LP)} solving the $L$ shortest paths problem is then
\begin{samepage}
\[
        \min \boldsymbol{c}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}
\]
subject to
\[
    \boldsymbol{0} \leq
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{A}_{s} \\
        \boldsymbol{A}_{p}
    \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{x}
    \leq \boldsymbol{1}
\]
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{A}_{b} \\
        \boldsymbol{A}_{c}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{x}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{0} \\
        \boldsymbol{1}
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
    \boldsymbol{0} \leq \boldsymbol{x} \leq \boldsymbol{1}
\]
\end{samepage}
where $\boldsymbol{A}_{s}$ is the matrix with $\boldsymbol{a}^{s,m}$ as its rows
for $m \in [0 \dotsc M-1]$ and $\boldsymbol{A}_{p}$ is the matrix with
$\boldsymbol{a}^{p,m}$ as its rows, etc.

\begin{figure}
    \caption{\label{plot:simple_graph_lp_paths}}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/small_graph_ex_lp_paths.eps}
\end{figure}

The solution of the two best paths using the LP formulation
is shown in Figure~\ref{plot:simple_graph_lp_paths} and a comparison of the
total costs is shown in Table~\ref{tab:greedy_lp_cost_compare}

\begin{table}
    \caption{\label{tab:greedy_lp_cost_compare} Comparison of total costs}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c c}
            Greedy & LP \\
            \hline
            \input{plots/small_graph_ex_greedy_cost.txt} &
            \input{plots/small_graph_ex_lp_cost.txt} \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The LP formulation is based on a multiple object tracking algorithm for video
\cite{jiang2007linear}. A proof that the solution $\boldsymbol{x}^{\ast}$ will
have entries equal to either $0$ or $1$ can be found in
\cite[p.~167]{parker1988discrete}. The theoretical computational complexity of
the linear program is polynomial in the number of variables, see
\cite{karmarkar1984new} for a proof and the demonstration of a fast algorithm
for finding its solution. In practice, to extract paths from the solution, we do
not test equality with $0$ or $1$ but rather test if the solution vector's
values are greather than some threshold. This may mean that suboptimal solutions
may still be close enough. The tolerance of the solutions to suboptimality
should be investigated, as if they are tolerant, fewer iterations of a
barrier-based algorithm would be required to solve the problem. More information
on linear programming and optimization in general can be found in
\cite{boyd2004convex}.

It should be noted that in the special case that only 1 shortest path is
searched an algorithm exists that requires on the order of $N^{2}T$ calculations
\cite{rabiner1989tutorial} where $N$ is the number of nodes in each frame and
$T$ is the number of frames (assuming the same number of nodes in each frame):
this algorithm is known as the Viterbi algorithm \cite{forney1973viterbi}.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:mq_lp_compare_chirp}Partial paths on example signal}

\subsection{Classification}

If data-points consist of more than two dimensions (say $p$), it becomes
burdensome to try and find the single best or two best dimensions on which to
examine for grouping. If we consider variables on each of the dimensions that
take on the data-point's corresponding values, we are interested in the
variables that capture most of the data-points's variance. In turns out we can
determine a linear transformation of our original dataset giving $p$ variables
and their $p$ variances such that the resulting variable with the highest
variance will have the maximum variance acheivable, under some constraints that
will be explained shortly. 

\subsubsection{Principal components analysis (PCA)}

The following development is based on \cite{jolliffe2002principal}. Say we have
a set $\left\{ \boldsymbol{x} \right\}$ of data-points and their covariance
matrix $\boldsymbol{S}$. A linear function of $\boldsymbol{x}$,
$f_1(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}$ has variance
$\sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}}=\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{a}_{1}$.
Therefore, we desire a vector $a$ that maximizes
$\sigma_{\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}}$. We can find this via the program
\[
        \max \boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{a}_{1}
\]
subject to
\[
    \boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{T}\boldsymbol{S}\boldsymbol{a}_{1}=1
\]
(to obtain a bounded solution).

The resulting function of $\boldsymbol{x}$,
$f_1(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a}_{1}^{\ast T}\boldsymbol{x}$ is called the first
\textit{principal component}. The second principal component
$f_2(\boldsymbol{x})=\boldsymbol{a}_{2}^{\ast T}\boldsymbol{x}$ is found similary
to the first, except with the additional constraint that it be uncorrelated
(orthogonal) to the first component, i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{a}_{2}^{\ast T}\boldsymbol{a}_{1}=0$, and the third is found by
requiring orthognality with the first two principal components, etc.

The principal components (PCs) now allow us to examine for grouping more easily as the
total variance of the dataset has been captured in the first few principal component
variables. These transformed data-points can now be classified using a
classification algorithm.

Before we continue describing classification techniques we will briefly discuss
the nature of our classification problem. If accurate and consistent
measurements of data-points can be made, and a large enough sample of
data-points is available to train a model, then to predict the classification of
new points, a function $g=\hat{h} \left( \boldsymbol{x} \right)$ is postulated,
giving the classification $g$ of a data-point $\boldsymbol{x}$. There are many
ways to determine $\hat{h}$ based on its assumed form. For example, if it is
assumed that $h \left( \boldsymbol{x} \right) =
\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}^{T}\boldsymbol{x}$ then a common estimator of
$\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$, given $\boldsymbol{X}$, a matrix of observations of
$\boldsymbol{x}$ with the observations as its rows, and the classifications
$\boldsymbol{y}$, is \cite[p.~12]{friedman2001elements}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:least_squares}
    \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}} = \left( \boldsymbol{X}^{T}\boldsymbol{X}
    \right)^{-1} \boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{y}
\end{equation}
Here we do not have a sample dataset because of the large number of possible
situations and the difficulty of consistently estimating underlying model
parameters (see, for example, Section~\ref{sec:mq_lp_compare_chrip}). To automate
classification we treat the dataset beforehand to increase the robustness of the
classification algorithm, and allow the algorithm to estimate some
class memberships. The classification algorithm will give some estimated $\hat{h}$
as above, but it is doubtful that we would find a situation to use it to
classify new data-points. In the case that the classification gives a continuous
variable as in Equation~\ref{eq:least_squares}, thresholding values are
required to convert $\hat{h} \left( \boldsymbol{x} \right)$ to discrete values.
Because we would have to choose these values beforehand, this sort of
classification algorithm is probably not very useful in practice. For this
reason we opt for classification algorithms that give discrete indicators as
output, purely as a function of the input dataset. The algorithm we consider is the
\textit{Gaussian mixture model (GMM)}.

\subsubsection{Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)}

Consider the data-points $\boldsymbol{X}$ as realizations of the vector Gaussian
distributed random variable
$X$. With a large enough sample and a small enough covariance, we will observe
realizations of $X$ as a cluster with some mean (centre point) $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a shape
described by the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$. If we observe multiple
clusters this might imply that there are $P$ different distributions each with
mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}_p$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_p$ and on each
iteration one is chosen with probability $w_p$. With $N$ observations
$\boldsymbol{x}_{n}$ we can estimate, via maximum likelihood, the $P$ sets of
parameters using a form of the \textit{expectation maximization (EM)} algorithm
\cite{moon1996expectation}, \cite{dempster1977maximum}, which is an algorithm
suitable for estimating missing data from known ones. First, define
\[
    \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_{n} | p \right)
    \doteq
    \ddfrac{
        \mathcal{N} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_{n}; \boldsymbol{\mu}^{k}_{p} ,
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{k}_{p} \right) w^{k}_{p}
    }{
        \sum_{l=1}^{P}
        \mathcal{N} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_{n}; \boldsymbol{\mu}^{k}_{l} ,
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{k}_{l} \right) w^{k}_{l}
    }
\]
the probability that $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ given distribution $p$ (see
Appendix~\ref{apdx:gaussian_dist} for the definition of $\mathcal{N} \left(
\boldsymbol{\mu}^{k} , \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{k} \right)$). The superscript $k$
indicates the value of this parameter on iteration $k$. To update $w^{k}_p$:
\[
    w^{k+1}_p = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n |
    p \right)
\]
which means intuitively that the probability of a data-point having been
generated by distribution $p$ is the average probability of observing any
$\boldsymbol{x}_n$ given $p$. To update $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{k+1}_p$:
\[
    \boldsymbol{\mu}^{k+1}_p
    =
    \ddfrac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n |
    p \right) \boldsymbol{x}_n }{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n |
    p \right)}
\]
which is a weighted mean of all the data-points. Those less likely for a
given $p$ will weight the mean less and vice versa. A similar computation is
made for $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{k+1}_p$:
\[
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{k+1}_p
    =
    \ddfrac{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n | p \right)
        \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n - \boldsymbol{\mu}^{k+1}_p \right) \left(
        \boldsymbol{x}_n - \boldsymbol{\mu}^{k+1}_p \right)^{T}
    }{
        \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n | p \right)
    }
\]
The algorithm is halted after some number of iterations or when convergence is
reached (the parameters change little each iteration). After convergence, the
classification $p^{\ast}$ of the data-point $\boldsymbol{x}$ is simply
\[
    p^{\ast} = \argmax_{p} \mathrm{p} \left( \boldsymbol{x}_n | p \right)
\]

\subsection{Partial synthesis}

Once the parameters have been estimated, the partials have been determined, and
the partials have been grouped into sources, we can now synthesize a single
source by choosing only those partials belonging to a single source and
resynthesizing from the parameters in some fashion. A popular technique that is
straightforward to implement is the \textit{overlap-and-add} procedure
\cite{portnoff1976implementation}, \cite{moore1990elements}. We assume that in
the neighbourhood of $\tau_{r}$ the signal is approximately described by the
function $x(n) \approx f_{\tau_{r}}(n-\tau_{r})$. To synthesize an approximation of $x$
we sum windowed $f_{\tau_{r}}$ at multiple locations, windowed by a function $w$
with finite support so
the resulting signal has finite energy and the piecewise assumption is
maintained. For simplicity we assume the $\tau_{r}$ are equally spaced by $H$
samples, and $\tau_{0}=0$, so we have $\tau_{r} = rH$. The length of the window
function $w$ is $M$ samples. The approximate signal at sample $n$ is then
\[
    \tilde{x}(n) = \sum_{l=L_{-}}^{L^{+}} w(n-lH) f_{\tau_l}(n-\tau_l)
\]
where
\[
    L_{-} = \left\lfloor \frac{n-M}{H} + 1 \right\rfloor
\]
and
\[
    L_{+} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{H} \right\rfloor
\]
This method has some drawbacks. Usually the function $f$ is an approximation
$\tilde{f}$ of the true underlying function. In the case of partial tracking,
often partials that are too short are discarded or missed. At amplitude
transients, these short partials are important for reproducing sharp attacks
that are shorter than the window length. If these partials are missing, the
resulting signal takes on a transient similar to the window shape. This could be
overcome by choosing a window with a shape similar to the overall amplitude
envelope in the attack region when resynthesizing an attack transient.

Another drawback is that no attempt is made to interpolate between the functions
estimated at $\tau_{r}$ and $\tau_{r+1}$. This is what is carried out in
Section~\ref{sec:mqfmfromphase} and results in a cubic interpolating polynomial
for phase. From Equation~\ref{eq:ddmsyseq} we know we can estimate a
polynomial of arbitrary order for phase. Perhaps using this additional
information will give us an interpolating function closer to the underlying
model.

\subsection{Extended phase model}

In Section~\ref{sec:mqfmfromphase} it was shown how a cubic phase function could
be postulated from two connected measurements (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialtracking}) giving a cubic phase polynomial. Here we will
demonstrate how to include the additional phase polynomial coefficients
estimated using DDM in calculating a phase function. In a later section we will
compare the synthesis quality of the classical McAulay \textendash Quatieri
approach with our new method.

\subsubsection{Cubic phase polynomial\label{sec:cubicphasepoly} }

In this section we describe how to obtain a cubic phase polynomial from
local estimations of the coefficients of a quadratic phase polynomial.

A complex sinusoid with cubic phase has the following form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cubicphasepoly}
    \phi(n) = \exp \left(c_3 n^{3} + c_2 n^{2} + c_1 n + c_0 \right)
\end{equation}
One with quadratic phase has this form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quadraticphasepoly}
    x(n) = \exp \left(a_2 n^{2} + a_1 n + a_0 \right)
\end{equation}
with $c_{i} \in \mathbb{C}$ and $a_{i} \in \mathbb{C}$.

We can estimate the coefficients of Equation~\ref{eq:quadraticphasepoly} using the DDM. From
Equation~\ref{eq:ddmsyseq}, we define the three functions
\begin{equation}
    X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} w(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} 2 m w(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k \right)
    =
    -j 2 \pi \frac{k}{M} X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau , k \right) + 
    \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \frac{dw}{dn}(m) x(m + \tau) \exp(-j 2 \pi \frac{k m}{M})
\end{equation}
Where $M$ is the length of the window and $k$ is the frequency ``bin". We also
only consider $x$ at the samples $m = [0, \dotsc, M-1]$ because we can always
shift the time reference to view an arbitrary contiguous segment of signal with
these indices.

We then find $k^{\ast}$ such that $X_{p_{1}}$ is maximum. If multiple components
are present in the signal and are sufficiently separated in frequency, we can
split the signal up into frequency bands and find local maxima. A technique for
doing so is described in \cite[p.~42]{serra1989system}. To have a system of equations
with a unique solution, take the two adjacent bins $k-1$ and $k+1$ to have
enough unique atoms for Equation~\ref{eq:ddmsyseq}. These bins
should only contain energy from the component whose parameters we are interested
in measuring \textemdash this is true if the components are adequately separated
in time and frequency. We could choose only two bins to have a non-singular
system, and there are many possibilities for choosing different atoms
\cite[p.~4639]{betser2009sinusoidal}. We choose three to have improved
estimation accuracy in situations where components are adaquately separated in
frequency. Then $a_2$ and $a_1$ can be determined by solving the linear system
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) \\
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) \\
        X_{p_{1}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right) & X_{p_{2}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        a_1 \\
        a_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} - 1 \right) \\
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} \right) \\
        X_{w^{\prime}} \left( \tau, k^{\ast} + 1 \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
With $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ determined, we can use Equation~\ref{eq:ddmestc0} to
estimate $a_0$. We will write $a^{\tau}_{i}$ to refer to coefficient $i$
determined at time $\tau$. Once the $\boldsymbol{a}^{\tau}$ have been determined
at two times $\tau_{0}$ and $\tau_{1}$, with $H = \tau_{1} - \tau_{0}$ and these
times have between determined as connected (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialtracking}), we can write a system of equations
to determine an interpolating cubic phase polynomial. To avoid numerical
instabilities and for simplicity, we shift the time origin so that $\tau_{0} =
0$. This means $c_0 = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}$. To reduce the size
of the system, we require that 
\[
    \frac{d \phi}{d n} \left(\frac{H}{2} \right)
    =
    \frac{1}{2}
    \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{1} \right\} + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{1}
    \right\} \right)
\]
and
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \phi}{d n^{2}} \left(\frac{H}{2}
    \right)
    =
    \frac{1}{2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
    a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right)
\]
i.e., the frequency and first-order frequency modulation in the middle of the
segment are the average of the two measured coefficients. Finally we require
\[
    \phi \left( H \right)
    =
    \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{0} \right\} - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}
    + 2 \pi U^{\ast}
\]
where $U^{\ast} \in \mathbb{Z}$ is determined to minimize
Equation~\ref{eq:minfmmq}, in this case:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:minfmcubic}
    \tilde{U} = \argmin_{U} \int_{0}^{H} \left(
    6 c_3 t + 2 c_2 \right)^{2} dt
\end{equation}
which is then rounded to the nearest integer to give $U^{\ast}$. To summarize we have
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^{3} & H^{2} & H \\
        \frac{3}{4}H^{2} & H & 1 \\
        3 H & 2 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{3} \\
        c_{2} \\
        c_{1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{0} \right\} - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{0} \right\}
            + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \\
        \frac{1}{2}
        \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{1} \right\} + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_{1}
        \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{1}{2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Solving for $c_1, \dotsc, c_3$, we have
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_{3} \\
        c_{2} \\
        c_{1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{4}{H^3} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        - \frac{2}{H^{2}} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{-6}{H^2} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        - \frac{3}{H} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            + \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right)
        + \frac{1}{4}  \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
            a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right) \\
        \frac{-H}{4}  \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_{2} \right\} + \Im \left\{
            a^{\tau_1}_{2} \right\} \right) 
        + \frac{3}{H} \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} + 2 \pi U^{\ast} \right)
        -  \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
            - \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
and then $\tilde{U}$ is determined using Equation~\ref{eq:minfmcubic} to be
\[
    \tilde{U} = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \left[ H \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1
            \right\} + \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \right)
        -2 \left( \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\} - \Im \left\{
        a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\} \right) \right]
\]
and then rounded to obtain $U^{\ast}$.

\subsubsection{Cubic amplitude polynomial \label{sec:cubicamppoly}}

Solving for the cubic polynomial describing the local amplitude function
\begin{equation}
    \mu(n) = \exp \left(d_3 n^{3} + d_2 n^{2} + d_1 n + d_0 \right)
\end{equation}
is more straightforward analytically as it does not require solving to maximize
the smoothness of resulting polynomial. To require continuity at the end-points
of our polynomial, we require
\[
    \mu(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
and
\[
    \mu(H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
\]
The first constraint is satisfied simply by setting $d_0 = \Re \left\{
a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}$ as in Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepoly}. The second will be
accounted for in a constrained least-squares solution for the other
coefficients. The other observations are
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{dn} (0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{dn} (H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^2 \mu}{dn^2} (0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^2 \mu}{dn^2} (H) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_2 \right\}
\]
The constrained least-squares problem to be solved is then
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
        3 H^2 & 2 H & 1 \\
        0 & 2 & 0 \\
        6 H & 2 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_3 \\
        d_2 \\
        d_1
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_1 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\} \\
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_2 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
subject to
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^3 & H^2 & H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_3 \\
        d_2 \\
        d_1
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_1}_0 \right\}
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
This can be solved using numerical methods, in particular, using a specific
interpretation of weighted least-squares \cite[p.~266]{golub1996matrix}.

\subsubsection{Quintic phase polynomial\label{sec:quinticphasepoly}}

Solving for the coefficients of a quintic phase polynomial is done very
similarly to Section~\ref{sec:cubicphasepoly}. The quintic phase polynomial is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quinticphasepoly}
    \phi(n) = \exp \left(c_5 n^{5} + c_4 n^{4} + c_3 n^{3} + c_2 n^{2} + c_1 n + c_0 \right)
\end{equation}
We have
\[
    \phi(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \phi}{d n}(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \phi}{d n^{2}}(0) = \Im \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
and solving for the remaining coefficients is done using the linear system of
equations:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^5 & H^4 & H^3 \\
        5 H^4 & 4 H^3 & 3 H^2 \\
        20 H^3 & 12 H^2 & 6 H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        c_5 \\
        c_4 \\
        c_3
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -\ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } \frac{ H^{2} }{2} - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } H +
            \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } + 2 \pi U^{\ast}\\
        -\ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } H + \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } \\
        \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 }
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The smoothness maximizing $\tilde{U}$ is found as
% M=np.round((20.*H*(w_i0+w_i1)+(H**2.)*(psi_i0-psi_i1)+40.*(phi_i0-phi_i1))/(80.*np.pi))
\[
    \tilde{U} = \frac{1}{80 \pi} \left[ 20 H ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } + \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } )
        + H^2 ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } )
        + 40 ( \ImNe{ a^{\tau_0}_0 } - \ImNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } ) \right]
\]
and then rounded to produce $U^{\ast}$ as above.

\subsubsection{Quintic amplitude polynomial}

Solving for the quintic amplitude polynomial
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quinticamppoly}
    \mu(n) = \exp \left(d_5 n^{5} + d_4 n^{4} + d_3 n^{3} + d_2 n^{2} + d_1 n + d_0 \right)
\end{equation}
is as follows:
\[
    \mu(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_0 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d \mu}{d n}(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_1 \right\}
\]
\[
    \frac{d^{2} \mu}{d n^{2}}(0) = \Re \left\{ a^{\tau_0}_2 \right\}
\]
and solving for the remaining coefficients is done using the linear system of
equations:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        H^5 & H^4 & H^3 \\
        5 H^4 & 4 H^3 & 3 H^2 \\
        20 H^3 & 12 H^2 & 6 H
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        d_5 \\
        d_4 \\
        d_3
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        -\ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } \frac{ H^{2} }{2} - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } H +
            \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_0 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } \\
        -\ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 } H + \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_1 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_1 } \\
        \ReNe{ a^{\tau_1}_2 } - \ReNe{ a^{\tau_0}_2 }
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The quintic interpolating phase polynomial has been proposed in a previous paper
\cite{girin2003comparing} although they do not directly estimate the frequency
slope, choosing instead to derive it using the difference in frequency between
two analysis frames.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

We compared the quality of an analysis-synthesis system using the
original method proposed by McAulay and Quatieri, the cubic interpolation
method, and the quartic interpolation method. A frequency- and
amplitude-modulated sinusoid was synthesized and then analysed frame-by-frame
using the DDM to estimate its initial phase (amplitude), frequency (amplitude
slope), and frequency-modulation (amplitude-modulation). Afterwards, the signal
was resynthesized using the estimated parameters and compared with the original.

The synthesized signal has 3 frequency break-points and an initial phase,
therefore its phase function can be interpolated by a cubic polynomial
\[
    x_{\phi}(n) = \exp \left(b_3 n^{3} + b_2 n^{2} + b_1 n + b_0 \right)
\]
the frequency break-points are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cubicsinphparams}. The
initial phase is $0$ radians.

\begin{table}
    \caption{\label{tab:cubicsinphparams}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|c c c}
            Time (seconds) & 0 & 0.25 & 0.5 \\
            Frequency (Hz) & 100 & 200 & 100
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

A quartic polynomial is used for the amplitude function
\[
    x_{\mu}(n) = \exp \left(u_4 n^{4} u_3 n^{3} + u_2 n^{2} + u_1 n + u_0 \right)
\]
and its amplitude break-points are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:quarticsinampparams}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{\label{tab:quarticsinampparams}}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|c c c c}
            Time (seconds) & 0 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 \\
            Amplitude (dB) & -10 & 0 & 0 & -10
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The signal was sampled with a sampling rate of 16000 Hz and was analysed every
256 samples with an analysis window of length 1024 samples. For the DDM method, the
$\mathcal{C}^{1}$ 4-Term Blackman-Harris was used (see
Section~\ref{sec:optblackman}).

    misleading because phase values should be compared after computing the
    remaineder when dividing by $2\pi$. This means there are only brief segments
    where the phase error is significant (compare with
    Figure~\ref{plot:mqcubicerror}). The plot is shown without adjusting the
    values to show the accuracy of the proposed methods in the interpolated

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

Out of the three proposed methods it appears that the modified cubic
interpolation method works superiorily for the signal model considered. The
reduced accuracy of the higher-order quintic model can perhaps be explained by
the ``overfitting" of the log-amplitude function (see
Figure~\ref{plot:mqmoderrcomplogampfunc}). Indeed, even the proposed cubic model
shows some overfitting in this case. From Figure~\ref{plot:mqmoderrcompphaseerr}
it is clear that the DDM based methods provide superior estimation of the phase
function -- this is not the case for the log-amplitude function. Depending on
the underlying signal, perhaps better results can be obtained by postulating a
lower-order amplitude function and higher-order phase function. The possiblity
of errors arising from numerical accuracy when evaluating the quintic
polynomials has been ruled out. We evalutated these polynomials using an
implementation of Horner's method that keeps track of the error bound
\cite[p.~95]{higham2002accuracy}: the
errors are negligible, see Figure~\ref{plot:mqmodquinticpolyevalerr} for the
results.
