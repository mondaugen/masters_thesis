<h2>Grouping of partial trajectories for additive synthesis:</h2>
<p>
One model of audio is the sum of sinusoids plus noise model, here referred to as
the additive synthesis model. The additive synthesis model is convenient because
it is efficient (the waveforms can be synthesized using table look&#8209;up) and
allows for easy and intuitive manipulation of the sinusoidal components (it is
straightforward to change the amplitude and frequency of a sinusoid) and as
opposed to STFT synthesis, no phase update schemes are required. The estimation
of the sinusoidal trajectories is problematic in that, in their estimation, we
are limited to point representations of their values in time, commonly referred
to as partials in the context of audio. This means algorithms have to be devised
that connect or group these points, ideally taking into consideration the case
where an observation point occludes another. Once partial trajectories have been
determined, it may be desireable to group these trajectories according to
different criteria, e.g., for source separation. For this we consider partial
parameters common of those coming from the same source, e.g., their frequency
and amplitude modulation, or the fundamental frequency to which they belong.
</p>
<p>
The computation of partial trajectories involves:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    Accurate estimation of the partial parameters such as frequency, slope and
    their modulations.
    </li>
    <li>
    Grouping partials occuring at the same time as coming from the same source.
    </li>
    <li>
    Connecting partials across time as belonging to the same trajectory.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
We will implement and compare a variety of modern techniques for (1) and
evaluate their contribution to (2) and (3). Specifically, we will investigate how
knowledge of the frequency slope and the harmonicity of partials can improve
their grouping.
</p>
<p>
For partial parameters the techniques investigated will be:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Basis pursuit[5]</li>
    <li>Derivative method[4]</li>
    <li>Reassignment method[3]</li>
    <li>Parabolic interpolation[2]</li>
    <li>Adaptive Quasi&#8209;harmonic model[1]</li>
</ol>
<p>
For multiple F0 estimation, aiding in the grouping of partials, we will use the
technique of Puckette and Doval, with a refinement involving a negated harmonic
comb window.[6]
</p>
<p>
For (2) we will consider K features of each partial and attempt to cluster
components based on their R principle components using a clustering technique
such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM).[7][8]
</p>
<p>
Subsections will be:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Principle components analysis description</li>
    <li>Peak picking</li>
    <li>Expectation Maximization and its application to GMM</li>
</ol>
<p>
For (3) we will use a technique previously applied to tracking multiple objects
across video frames. It has been shown that high quality solutions to this
problem can be obtained through linear programming. [9]
