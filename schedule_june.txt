What to do in June:

Source separation experiments:
Source separation on AM and FM signals
AM
synthetic, separate analyses
synthetic, lumped analysis
FM
synthetic, separate analyses
synthetic, lumped analysis
Real AM equivalent (e.g., 2 percussive instruments)
separate analyses
lumped analysis
Real FM equivalent (e.g., 2 violins playing with vibrato)
separate analyses
lumped analysis

Then, write-up:

DDM,
LP partial tracking
PCA
GMM?

Then do overview of other techniques:
NMF, basically
