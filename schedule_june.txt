What to do in June:

Source separation experiments:
Source separation on AM and FM signals
AM
synthetic, separate analyses
synthetic, lumped analysis
Steps:
- See if DDM gives good estimation of amplitude slope and then plot a histogram of the slope, perhaps divided by frequency or partial number
- If so, use this to separate two sounds with different amplitude slopes
- We need to see though if this is true of real sounds
    - After observing synthetic sound, observe real sound
    - Draw conclusion (works or doesn't work)
FM
synthetic, separate analyses
synthetic, lumped analysis
Problems:
- Probably when the partials cross, you wont be able to resolve them. To help with this, you can use a light Wiener filter based on the analysis of the last frame to filter out the crossing frame (which might have more components than you want).
Real AM equivalent (e.g., 2 percussive instruments)
separate analyses
lumped analysis
Real FM equivalent (e.g., 2 violins playing with vibrato)
separate analyses
lumped analysis

Then, write-up:

DDM,
LP partial tracking
PCA
GMM?

Then do overview of other techniques:
NMF, basically

If you have time:

Show other methods that estimate phase functions
Basis Pursuit Denoising
Quasi-Harmonic model

Show actual source separation example using NMF

Show how very close partials could be resolved using the AM parameter and then
estimating the phase by minimizing an error function.

LP:
It's looking like it might not be useful for sounds that I can imagine. Is there a case where we want many paths through a very short lattice?
